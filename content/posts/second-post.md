This is the second post. 

Let's see what else you can do with markdown.

Here is a [link to Google!](http://google.com)

**Here is making some text bold.**

So actually that wasn't a heading as referred to [in my first post.](/posts/my-first-post)

Nice so the relative linking works as evidenced above.

I am referring to this [mastering markdown guide.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)

Here is a numbered list:
1. Hi
2. How
3. Are
4. You
5. Doing?

Okay let's embed some images.

`This is a code block`

    // you can also indent with four spaces
    if (isAwesome){
        return true
    }
